### Overview: 
Roza is a biological researcher who is tasked to create an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset 
which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. She is particularly interested in bacteria that have the ability to synthesize protein that tastes like beef. 
A food start up company Improbable Beef is particularly interested in the bacterial species that tastes better or very close to beef. The company partnered with 
Roza's lab to research on that species. She has narrowed her research on species that are found in human belly buttons. 
Roza has reviewed the dataset but wants to present a website to the volunteers where they can identify the top 10 species in their belly buttons. 
This will assist the volunteers to match the bacterial species to the one that Improbable Beef identifies to use in their product.

### Results
Roza was able to built an interactive webpage with a Subject ID dropdown that displays demographic info about the candidate.
A bar chart that displays the top 10 bacterial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs) found in the candidate's navel.
A bubble chart that displays bacterial cultures per sample and a guage chart to plot the weekly washing frequency of the candidate.

### Summary
Roza created a github page to allow her candiates to use the webpage. This was also very cost efficient approach to identify the bacterial species in hum belly button.
